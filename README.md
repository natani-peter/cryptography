## CRYPTOGRAPHY APP

### INTRODUCTION

This Cryptography App allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using various classical ciphers
such as Vigenère Cipher, Affine Cipher, and Caesar Cipher.
The user interface is designed for a smooth and interactive experience using `customtkinter`.
Each cipher has dedicated tabs for encryption, decryption, and helpful information.

### Features

- **Vigenère Cipher**
    - Encrypt and decrypt text using the Vigenère cipher method.

- **Affine Cipher**
    - Encrypt and decrypt text using the Affine cipher method.

- **Caesar Cipher**
    - Encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher method.

- **Tabbed Interface**
    - Each cipher has its own set of tabs (Encrypt, Decrypt, Help) to make navigation intuitive.

- **Clipboard Operations**
    - Copy and paste text directly from the application.

### How to Use

1. **Select a Cipher**:

   Choose from the three available ciphers in the outer tabview (Vigenère, Affine, Caesar).
2. **Encrypt or Decrypt**:
   Switch to the `Encrypt` or `Decrypt` tab based on what you want to do.
    - Enter your text and key.
    - Click the `Encrypt` or `Decrypt` button to process the text.
3. **Copy or Paste**:

   Use the clipboard operations to copy the result or paste input text directly into the fields.
